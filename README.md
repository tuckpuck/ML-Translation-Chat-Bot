# Machine Learning Chatbot
Translation Chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (API.ai) and Google Translate to offer quick translations into over 100 languages. The service needs two things: text you want to translate and the language to translate to. It is able to auto-detect the language of your text and returns a response. 

The translation chatbot is envisioned as a way to make translations more user-friendly by adding the ability to communicate in full sentences and adding small talk capabilities. Technologies of note used in the project are API.ai, Google Cloud Functions, and SASS.

NOTE: This project doesn't work anymore since Google updated their DialogFlow API to Version 2.
